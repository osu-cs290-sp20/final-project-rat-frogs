HOW TO ACCESS THE PAGE:

PREREQUISITES: Have Node.js and a machine that isn't from 1609
1) Clone the repository onto your local machine
2) Open the terminal and navigate to the saved location of the repository
3) Type the following command in the terminal: 'npm start'
4) Navigate to 'localhost:####' where #### is the port. 
5) Site can be navigated through clicking buttons, but all site URLs are as follows:

Preliminary idea:
Frog website 3 will be a website that will allow you to access three pages. 

The home page:
'/' will contain a button and play some sort of audio. At the top of the home page there will be a navbar which
has two buttons, "Frogs" and "Frog Facts". Clicking on the button should pull up a menu which allows the user to upload
an image to '/frogs' and change its pixel colors.

Frog page:
Found at '/frogs' and can be accessed by typing the URL or clicking the button from the home page. This will contain images of
all frogs uploaded to the database via the home page upload button. Generally, the program should read the image data of whatever is
uploaded, and pixels that match generic frog colors (Greens in our case) should be able to be changed to another color at the user's 
choosing. Depending on time we can implement basic code or a few colors like red, blue, purple. 

Frog Fact Page:
Found at '/frog-facts', this page is simply a bunch of frog facts and pictures of frogs, and should also contain links to additional pages like wikipedia for
more frog information. This page will also play wacky audio.
